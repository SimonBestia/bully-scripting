## Description

Removes all ambient pedestrians in the area. Note that this does not clear mission-specific peds—only those not marked as mission-critical. Pedestrians created by scripts won’t be deleted unless they have been marked with [**PedMakeAmbient**](https://bully-scripting.vercel.app/docs/game-reference/global-functions/PedMakeAmbient).

```lua
function AreaClearAllPeds() --[[ ... ]] end
```

## Parameters

None.
