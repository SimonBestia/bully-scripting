# Controls

Controls are made up of multiple buttons and sticks on each controller, where the term 'controller' also refers to the keyboard.

The main controller being used to play is always _0_, and up to 3 other controllers can take up slots _1_, _2_, and _3_.

The names of controls are made up based on their functionality, but the list is complete.
