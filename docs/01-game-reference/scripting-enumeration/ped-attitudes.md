# Ped Attitudes

Ped attitudes are initially set by `/Config/dat/Attitude.dat`, but are sometimes changed by the game based on progress or by scripts. A ped's attitude affects how they treat other factions, and also keeps the ped from being able to hit other peds if they adore them.

The names of attitudes come directly from the game's code, and have not been modified.
