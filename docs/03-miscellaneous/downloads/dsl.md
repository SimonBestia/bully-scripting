# Derpy's Script Loader

Derpy's Script Loader (DSL) is a script loader for Bully: Scholarship Edition (PC). It aims to take away all of the hassle and limitations that used to come with scripting the game.

For more information, see the [about page](/docs/dsl-reference/basic-concepts/about-dsl) and be sure to read the `readme.txt` that comes with the download. Also check out the Discord to stay updated, share mods, and ask questions.

Versions with an **S** do not have any **system access** functionality. Although these features are off by default and the user must explicitly enable it in their config, **non-S** versions may still trip anti-virus software and are only recommended if you know what you're doing.

The current client version is derpy's script loader 10 - S.

The current server version is derpy's script server 9 - S.

If you need some other version, see [all versions](https://www.mediafire.com/folder/clgtvlrnat179/derpy's_script_loader).
